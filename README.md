# VBA-challenge

I am aware it is all messed up ^^
Got the weird problem where it kept overflowing that Chris and you were helping me with "fixed." 
But it came up with other weird things to do.
Then I tried running it on the actual file it is supposed to analyze and it stopped running through all the worksheets and I'm over it...
I don't think I like VBA.
